# DC2F API Endpoint to edit content

EXPERIMENTAL .. as verything.

Aims to build a http server with a simple rest api to modify content of a
dc2f static publish website. (of https://github.com/dc2f/dc2f.kt)

Writing templates and defining the content structure would still be done using
kotlin. But content editors should get some nice UI.
